The online-darts-league app allows users to play darts matches against each other online, to run a demo version of it you have to

- Start the [backend](https://codesandbox.io/s/fancy-surf-4pk0dc) up and wait until `Nest application successfully started` appears in the terminal or browser window.
- Start the [frontend](https://codesandbox.io/s/suspicious-waterfall-ztm9sd) up.
- Start a second instance of the frontend in another browser or device, this is important because the app would register you as already logged in otherwise.
- Log in with the user credentials I provided below. You can also create your own users on the signup page.
- Click on the ready button of the home page in both frontend instances.
