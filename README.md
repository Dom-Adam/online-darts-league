# online-darts-league

The online-darts-league app allows users to play darts matches against each other online, to run a demo version of it you have to

- Start the [backend](https://codesandbox.io/s/fancy-surf-4pk0dc) up and wait until `Nest application successfully started` appears either in the terminal or browser window
- Start the [frontend](https://codesandbox.io/s/suspicious-waterfall-ztm9sd) and log in with the credentials of user1 which are provided below
- Start a second instance of the frontend in another browser or device and log in with the credentials of user2
- Click on the ready button of the home page in both frontend instances
- now a match should have been created and you can enter your scores

## user credentials

| username | password  | email                |
| :------- | :-------- | :------------------- |
| user1    | password1 | example1@example.com |
| user2    | password2 | example2@example.com |

You could also create your own users on the sign-up page, you just can't be logged in as the same user in both frontend instances, otherwise you cannot create matches.
